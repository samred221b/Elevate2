# 🚀 Render Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 📁 Repository Setup
- [ ] All code committed and pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public (or Render paid plan for private)
- [ ] `render.yaml` file is in root directory
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore` (never commit secrets!)

### 🗄️ Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas account created
- [ ] Cluster created (free M0 tier)
- [ ] Database user created with read/write permissions
- [ ] Network access configured (0.0.0.0/0 for Render)
- [ ] Connection string copied and ready

### 🔧 Configuration Files
- [ ] `render.yaml` configured with correct service names
- [ ] Backend CORS updated with production URLs
- [ ] Health check endpoint exists (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Vite config optimized for production

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Render Services
- [ ] Go to [dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com)
- [ ] Click "New +" → "Blueprint"
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Select your habit-tracker repository

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

#### Backend Service Environment Variables:
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- [ ] `PORT` = `10000`
- [ ] `MONGODB_URI` = `your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string`
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` = `generate-secure-random-string`
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` = `https://your-frontend-name.onrender.com`
- [ ] `JWT_EXPIRE` = `7d`

#### Frontend Service Environment Variables:
- [ ] `VITE_API_URL` = `https://your-backend-name.onrender.com`
- [ ] `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### 3. Monitor Deployment
- [ ] Backend service builds successfully
- [ ] Frontend service builds successfully
- [ ] Health check responds: `https://your-api.onrender.com/api/health`
- [ ] Frontend loads: `https://your-frontend.onrender.com`

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### Backend API Tests:
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-api-name.onrender.com/api/health

# Should return:
{
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "Habit Tracker API is running",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456
}
```

### Frontend Tests:
- [ ] Website loads without errors
- [ ] Login/Register forms work
- [ ] Can create habits and categories
- [ ] Data persists after refresh
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend
- [ ] Authentication works end-to-end
- [ ] Database operations work (CRUD)
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Build Failures:
- [ ] Check build logs in Render dashboard
- [ ] Verify all dependencies in `package.json`
- [ ] Ensure Node.js version compatibility

#### Database Connection:
- [ ] Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string format
- [ ] Check database user permissions
- [ ] Confirm network access allows Render IPs

#### CORS Errors:
- [ ] Frontend URL matches backend CORS config
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable is correct
- [ ] No trailing slashes in URLs

#### Environment Variables:
- [ ] All required variables are set
- [ ] No typos in variable names
- [ ] Values are properly formatted

## 📊 Post-Deployment

### Monitoring:
- [ ] Set up Render service monitoring
- [ ] Monitor MongoDB Atlas usage
- [ ] Check application logs regularly

### Performance:
- [ ] Test application speed
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Check for memory leaks

### Security:
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Check JWT token expiration
- [ ] Monitor for suspicious activity
